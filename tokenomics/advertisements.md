# Advertisements

In the current state of web2, you are the product of the social media websites you interact with. The site collect data on you and sell it to advertisers and sell spots on their site for advertisers to advertise to you. This is extractive. You get a free service but they are forced to extract value from you somehow.&#x20;

On BlockIt, advertisers can bid using BLK for a space on our platform. By using the BLK token for this, advertisers are essentially paying users to advertise to them since the users are the ones who earned the coins.&#x20;
