# Profiles

We want the BlockIt community to organize and curated the platform together in the way they want. We feel the best way to do that is allow users to organize and "vouch" for each other. To do this we have designed a system around who a user is following and who is following them. Curating a good following is key to increasing your influence on the site.

## Weight and Capture Rate

Every user receives a weight of 1 when they mint their profile. Their weight increases as they interact with the system in any way. Each interaction a user makes reduces their capture rate by 10%. The capture rate is a multiplier on how much their weight will increase from every interaction. The capture rate regenerates overtime until reaching a max of 1. It increases exponentially so it is not recommended to drain your capture rate as it would take much longer to regenerate from 10 to 20 rather than 90 to 100.&#x20;

## Weight multiplier

There is another weight multiplier that is based off a users following and followers. The multiplier is determined using Google's PageRank algorithm. In summary, users share their multiplier with those they are following and increase their multiplier by getting followed. Therefore, a user with no followers will have a multiplier of 0 and will not increase any of their followers ranks. Also, the PageRank algorithm makes it so a user with many accounts following themselves does not increase their total multiplier at all since each account will give and receive an equivalent amount of multiplier increase.

## Bonuses

If a user wishes to simply lurk on our site and not work towards developing a following they can still increase the value of their profile by up/downvoting posts. These interactions will increase their weight and allow them to potentially sell their profile to someone who is new to the platform and wants to develop a following and have a higher influence on the site. This means someone with no money in the site can potentially earn by helping to curate the content by giving feedback on how the feel about a post.

Content creators are rewarded with a higher weight due to the followers they will receive. This can be very powerful because the will be able increase the&#x20;
