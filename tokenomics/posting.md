# Posting

Posting on our site is synonymous to making a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain after the EIP-1559 upgrade. There is a base fee every user must pay as well as an optional tip you can pay stakers of your post. There is also a BLK reward, which is determined after 24 hours and is dependent on how well the post scores. The poster receives a percentage of the reward.&#x20;

The base fee a user pays is calculated using the tokenomics outlined in EIP-1559 and the entire base fee is burned. The fee is near zero when there is not much activity on the site, but increases as more content is posted. Therefore, when the site first launches and not many people are on it, it will be free to post and earn. If the site is successful and many users enter the ecosystem, then users will have to begin burning tokens in order to post. More posting leads to more rewards and therefore higher inflation, but also leads to more burning and therefore deflation. We expect these trade offs to lead to a healthy economy.

The base fee also discourages spamming and low-quality content. Our goal is to design a economic system that punishes bad actors. These bad actors can come in many forms, but some examples are misinformation, bots, reposters, spammers, multi-accounters, etc. Since these things are bad for the platform, users are incentivized to weed them out
