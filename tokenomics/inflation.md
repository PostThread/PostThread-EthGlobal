# Inflation

The BLK token is highly inflationary to discourage speculators. In the past we have seen many blockchain game tokens reach unsustainable prices due to speculators. This may seem great for gamers that had already played and earned in the game, but is very negative for the future success of the game since it is so expensive for new users to enter. This leads to less users and less activity. Social media is all about activity, so if our app does well and therefore our token does well, we don't want it to discourage people from interacting with our app by making it too expensive.

## How does inflation fix speculation?

If someone wants to speculate on our token they can buy it just like any other token. However, to keep the value of their investment they must use those tokens to earn the high yield. Every interaction on the site can be thought of as staking your tokens and that stake will always earn you tokens. Staking them on a higher quality post will earn you more, but if you accidently stake on a low quality post you will still earn your tokens back. The idea is that each day the token supply will increase by a substantial amount, but so will your token amount if you interact with the site.&#x20;

## How much inflation?

The goal of BlockIt is to reward the users that use and provide to the platform, so we plan to reward them with 1% of the total supply of the token per day from a community fund. Each day the fund will accrue tokens from transaction fees on the platform. If the fund does not reach 1% of the total supply of the token, then tokens will be minted to make up for this. If there is a surplus, the tokens will remain to be used for the subsequent days. If the surplus remains after 1 week then the community can decide what to do with it. The DAO can vote to use it for improvements to site (i.e. pay the engineers or hire new ones), burn them, use them as extra rewards, etc.&#x20;

## Why not burn tokens?

Burning tokens benefits all holders of the BLK token. In our effort to limit speculation, we believe there are better ways to benefit holders that are actively helping the platform. Therefore, community tokens will always be pooled to be used later.
