# SubBlockIts

For now, when a user mints a post, they will specify which category they want the post to be under. This will allow for easier searching and grouping of posts, but there will not be designated subblockit communities at the start. There is a main page with all posts and a filter by category button.&#x20;

In the future, as the community grows, it will want to segment into smaller groups with their own moderation, rules and potentially economy. We are open to this and would like to allow for it, but feel it is not needed at the start. Some ideas for the future however are to allow users to mint a subblockit and create their own DAO and token. This would allow them to make and enforce their own rules&#x20;
