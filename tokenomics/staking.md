# Staking

Every post can be thought of as a token farm. The sooner a user stakes their tokens into a post after creation, the more yield you will earn from a posts bonus. The post bonus is determined after 24 hours have past at which point you can withdraw your tokens plus the bonus. The bonus amount is determined by how many upvotes, downvotes and staked tokens a post receives. The exact algorithm will be constantly changing through votes in the DAO. The reason for this is to give a voice to the community in how they want their site to be rewarded as well as to make it harder for people to game the system.&#x20;
